Summary
---
Interactive dashboard to facilitate viewing and analyzing salary expenditures from publicly available data from Suffolk County, NY.

Data is downloaded as CSV file and then preprocessed using Python in a Jupyter Labs environment. 

Preprocessing involved cleaning data to remove personally identifiable information, removing irrelevant columns, renaming columns for clearer context, and reformatting all job titles to include only title name and no title code. 

Data is then exported to a final CSV file to be used in Tableau to build interactive dashboard.
